    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Beef stroganoff is a Russian dish of saut√©ed pieces of beef in a sauce
        of mustard and smetana. From its origins in mid-19th-century Russia, it
        has become popular around the world, with considerable variation from
        the original recipe.

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                Remove any fat and gristle from chuck roast; cut into strips
                1/2-inch thick by 2-inches long. Season with 1/2 teaspoon salt
                and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add beef and
                brown quickly.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Push beef to one side of the skillet. Add onions; cook and stir
                for 3 to 5 minutes, then push to the side with beef.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Stir flour into juices on the empty side of the pan. Pour in
                beef broth and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Lower the
                heat and stir in mustard. Cover and simmer for 1 hour or until
                the beef is tender.

                pepper.
